//Ex1: Using a when expression, update the following program so that when you input the names of GameBoy buttons,
// the actions are printed to output.

//Ex2: You have a program that counts pizza slices until thereâ€™s a whole pizza with 8 slices.
// Refactor this program in two ways:
//(i) using the while statement
//(ii) using the do-while statement

//Ex3: Write a program that simulates the Fizz buzz game. Your task is to print numbers from 1 to 100 incrementally,
// replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".
// Any number divisible by both 3 and 5 must be replaced with the word "fizzbuzz".
//Hint
//Use a for loop to count numbers and a when expression to decide what to print at each step.
